# 🖼️ Image Caption Generator (TensorFlow + CNN + LSTM)

A deep learning project that generates captions for images using a CNN + LSTM model.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- **CNN**: Extracts features from input images
- **LSTM (RNN)**: Generates natural language captions based on image features

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL

## 📄 Files
- `model.ipynb`: Complete model and training code
- `dataset/`: (Optional sample or link)
- `captions.txt`: Sample captions and tokenizer

## 📝 Summary
This project combines computer vision and NLP to build an end-to-end caption generation system. It highlights my skills in model architecture, preprocessing, and deep learning.
